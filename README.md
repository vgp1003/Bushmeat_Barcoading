# Bushmeat Barcoading

## Introduction

   Bushmeat is meat from wildlife species hunted for human consumption. It is common in tropical areas of South America, Central Africa, and Asia (Fig. 1)[1]. Bushmeat is a critical nutritional and economic resource, however over exploitation has lead to sharp declines in the populations of many endangered reptile and mammal species. The international bushmeat trade is estimated to be worth over $60 billion/year. $15 billion of this revenue is estimated to be generated illegally [2]. This caould include sale of illegal species, underground markets, or products that have crossed borders illegaly. International laws and conventions protect endangered wildlife from bushmeat hunting, but these regulations depends on the ability to reliably identify morphologically ambiguous animal products.

   COX1 is a highly conserved mitochondiral gene that encodes a protein essential to respiration. It is an established standard for DNA barcoding with relialble applications for species identification, thus, it has promising potential as a bushmeat barcoding tool [3]. A 2010 study by Eaton et al. collected tissue samples from 7 different crocodile species in various South American and Central African locations and sequenced the COX1 gene. The study built a tree for the COX1 genes from the different crocodile species.
